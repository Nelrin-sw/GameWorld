    <p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. Created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the
        <br>Java programming language and released as a public alpha for personal computers in 2009, the game was officially
        <br>released in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten taking over development around then. Minecraft has since been
        <br>ported to various platforms and become the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies sold
        <br>across all platforms and 126 million monthly active users as of 2020

    <p><b>Mobs can be passive, neutral, or hostile. Let's explain what this means.
    Passive mobs will never attack you.
    Hostile mobs will attack you when they see you.
    Neutral mobs will only attack during the day, if attacked first.</b></p>

    <h2><b>Hostile mobs</b></h2>

    <br><br>
    <p><b>Hostile mobs in Minecraft are dangerous and aggressive and will attack you within a certain range, usually 16 blocks, without any obstruction. However, some mobs are capable of detecting you from 100 blocks away. Flying mobs like a Minecraft phantom, will spawn above and attempt to swoop down and attack you. A boss mob is a special type of hostile, that has a larger detection range and more health, and includes the ender dragon and the Minecraft wither.
