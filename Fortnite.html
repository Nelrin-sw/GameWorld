    <p><b>Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in
    <br> three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and 
    <br>game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to 
    <br>fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build;
    <br> <img src="/images/fort/th (9).jpg" alt="Fortnite" height="300" width="500">
    <br> Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the last
    <br> person standing; and Fortnite Creative, where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and 
    <br>battle arenas. Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative
    <br> was released on December 6, 2018. Save the World is available only for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, 
    <br>and Xbox One, while Battle Royale and Creative released for all those 
    <br>platforms, and also for Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android devices. The game is expected to also launch 
    <br>with the release of the next-generation PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles</b>

    <p><b>Do we need to tell you what Fortnite is? You probably already play it, since Fortnite’s player count is 250 million and counting. Among them are the biggest Twitch streamers, sports stars, and celebrities. Epic’s battle royale really needs no introduction: it’s the biggest cultural shift in gaming since League of Legends.

    <br>Aside from being free to play, there are several reasons why Fortnite has wiped the floor with the 
    <br>competition. Despite being thrown together in a couple of months and bolted onto the side of the original 
    <br>Fortnite: Save the World game, this cartoony last-man-standing is the ever-evolving foundation for weekly updates,
    <br> seasonal changes, and a plethora of genre-defining new ideas.
    <br>
    <br>However often you log in, there’s always a new challenge to complete, and the Fortnite Battle Pass system 
    <br>rewards the most devout players with heaps of rewards. Casual players need not fear though; 
    <br>simple shooting and rules keep it accessible, and the building mechanics offers depth to chase.
