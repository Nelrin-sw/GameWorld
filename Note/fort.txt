Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode 
versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative 
shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they 
can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the last person 
standing; and Fortnite Creative, where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. Save the World 
and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December 6, 2018. Save the 
World is available only for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale and Creative released for all 
those platforms, and also for Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android devices. The game is expected to also launch with the release
of the next-generation PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles
