    <p><b>In Warframe, players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of suspended animation far into Earth's future to find themselves at war in the planetary system with different factions. The Tenno use their powered Warframes along with a 
    <br>variety of weapons and abilities to complete missions. While many of the game's missions 
    <br>use procedurally-generated levels, newer updates have included large open world areas similar to other
    <br> massively multiplayer online games as well as some story-specific missions with fixed level design.</b></p>
